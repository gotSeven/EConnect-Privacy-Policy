    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 5, 2026</p>
    <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to EConnect. This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Microtech Designs</strong> (“we,” “our,” or “us”)
      handles information in connection with your use of the <strong>EConnect</strong> mobile application (the “App”).
    </p>
    <p>Our core privacy principle is <strong>minimal data collection</strong>. The App is designed to connect to and
      manage your company’s devices. We do not collect personal information about you, such as your name, email address,
      or contact details. The limited data processing described below is solely for the core functionality of the App.
    </p>
    <p>By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</strong></p>
    <p>We want to be unequivocally clear about what we do <strong>not</strong> do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal identification information (e.g., name, email, address).</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> create user accounts or profiles.</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> track your activity across other apps or websites.</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for advertising, marketing, or analytics purposes.</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade any data to third parties.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>3. Information Processed for App Functionality</strong></p>
    <p>The App processes the following types of data strictly to provide its core features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device Location Data:</strong> The App requests access to your device’s location (GPS and
        network-based) <strong>only</strong> for the purpose of discovering, connecting to, and debugging <strong>your
          company’s physical devices</strong> via Bluetooth. <strong>We do not store or transmit your geographic
          location to our servers.</strong> Location data is processed locally on your device for the duration of the
        connection session.</li>
      <li><strong>Bluetooth Data:</strong> The App uses Bluetooth to establish a direct connection with your company’s
        devices for configuration, data monitoring, and debugging. All communication occurs directly between your mobile
        device and the target hardware.</li>
      <li><strong>Language Preference:</strong> The App saves your selected language setting (e.g., English, German,
        Chinese) locally on your device to maintain your preferred interface language. This setting is not linked to any
        identifiable user.</li>
      <li><strong>OTA Update Data:</strong> When you perform a firmware update (Over-The-Air) on a connected device, the
        App facilitates the transfer of the firmware file. We do not access, store, or collect the content of your
        device data transmitted during this process.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>4. How We Use the Information</strong></p>
    <p>The limited data mentioned in Section 3 is used <strong>exclusively</strong> for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To enable Bluetooth discovery and pairing with your company’s devices.</li>
      <li>To configure, debug, and monitor the performance of connected devices.</li>
      <li>To facilitate the installation of firmware updates (OTA) to connected devices.</li>
      <li>To preserve your in-App language setting for a consistent user experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>5. Data Storage and Retention</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All data processing (location, Bluetooth communication) occurs locally on
        your mobile device. We do not operate servers that collect or store this data.</li>
      <li><strong>Language Setting:</strong> Your language preference is stored locally on your device. You can reset it
        by changing the language within the App or by uninstalling the App.</li>
      <li><strong>No Retention:</strong> Since we do not collect personal information, there is no personal data to
        retain or delete from our systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>6. Your Privacy Rights</strong></p>
    <p>Although we do not hold your personal data, you maintain full control over the App’s permissions on your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can enable or disable access to <strong>Location Services</strong> and <strong>Bluetooth</strong> for
        EConnect at any time through your device’s settings. Please note that disabling these permissions will prevent
        the core functions of the App from working.</li>
      <li>You can uninstall the App at any time, which will remove all locally stored preferences (like your language
        setting).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>7. Third-Party Services</strong></p>
    <p>The App’s core functionality does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or social media SDKs that
      would collect user data.</p>
    <p><strong>8. Links to External Websites and Services</strong></p>
    <p>The EConnect App may provide links to external resources, such as product documentation and datasheets. These
      include links to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our official company website (e.g., <code>microtechdesigns.com.au</code>).</li>
      <li>Third-party file hosting services (e.g., Dropbox).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you tap on such a link, <strong>you will see a clear prompt on your screen informing you that you are about
        to leave the EConnect app.</strong> This prompt may provide additional context, such as distinguishing between
      links to our own website and links to third-party services.</p>
    <p><strong>Important Notice Regarding Third-Party Services:</strong>
      Please be aware that when you proceed to a third-party website or service, <strong>we have no control over its
        content, privacy policies, or practices.</strong> Any information you provide to or that is collected by these
      third parties is governed solely by their own privacy policies, not by this one. We strongly advise you to review
      the privacy policy of any external site you visit.</p>
    <p><strong>9. International Data Transfers</strong></p>
    <p>Your data is processed locally on your device. We do not transfer any user data internationally as we do not
      collect it in the first place.</p>
    <p><strong>10. Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
    <p>The App is not directed at individuals under the age of 13. As we do not knowingly collect any personal data from
      anyone, including children under 13, this issue is inherently mitigated.</p>
    <p><strong>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or
      regulatory reasons. We will post the updated policy within the App and update the “Last Updated” date. We
      encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
